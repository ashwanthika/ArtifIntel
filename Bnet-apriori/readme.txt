Language: Python3 

Task1:

Structure: Hard code the values, Compare the Sequence and the length, Compute the probablities accordingly. 
The computed Probablity is also writen into a file using file open and close operations. 
The "result.txt" is also saved. 

Execution:
python compute_a_posteriori.py observations
or
py compute_a_posteriori.py observations
Example: 
python compute_a_posteriori.py CCLLCLCL
py compute_a_posteriori.py CCLLCLCL


Task2:

Structure: From the given program, take the probablity values, Initialise them and give them the truth value.  Compute_from_global, Append_Hidden_var,Find_c1_c2,Set_val,Total_prob are the various functions used to compute the probablity using the formula. 
Our input can either contain a given value or not. Probablity is calculated accordingly. 

Execution:
(You can only provide a maximum of 6 arguments)
Example: 
python bnet.py At Bf given Mt
or 
py bnet.py Bf At Mt
python bnet.py Jt given Et Bf
